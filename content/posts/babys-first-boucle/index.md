I said in my [last spinning post](http://lainland.co.uk/posts/spinning/) that I had plans for both the undercoat and outercoat of the Shetland sheep's fleece I had recently purchased. Today I'm going to talk about the yarn I'm making with the soft downy undercoat.

My first foray into having a whole fleece delivered to our little flat started when my spouse told me about a knitting project they wanted to do. It's [a very cute hooded vest](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/kabine) made of a yarn that, when knitted up, makes a cozy teddy fabric.

The problem was, the yarn they needed to make this garnment was very, very expensive. The bulky boucle will run you £36 per 100g skein, and they needed 5 skeins. That's £180 total, which is definitely over our yarn budget.

The good new was, I had just heard of a book that would teach me exactly how to make any kind of boucle (and many other crazy yarns) I could possibly want.

So, I told my love not to worry, and ordered a copy of [The Spinner's Book of Yarn Designs](https://www.abebooks.co.uk/9781603427388/Spinners-Book-Yarn-Designs-Techniques-1603427384/plp).

A boucle yarn is made of 3 different plys. A thin core, a thicker looping ply, and a thin binder. In the spinning world it is acceptable to use a storebought yarn as the core and sewing thread as the binder, but that would be too easy. I want really cohesive colour and bits of a different coloured core peeking out is not idea. Plus it feels silly to buy yarn for the core when I've got all this fleece lying around...

I didn't want to waste any of the beautiful fibre I had worked so hard carding, so I practiced the looping on some stuff I had lying around. It takes two passes to ply this yarn. A first, holding the core yarn tight and letting the looping yarn coil around it loosely, then a second pass wrapping the binder around the first two plies to open the coils up into wavy little loops.

I found it quite tricky at first to get the right amount of the looping ply around the core. My handspun version will definitely not be as neat and consistant as the commercial yarn pictured above, but it should have a similar effect when knitted up.

My spouse bought 300g of hand-painted roving for the looping ply and I've carded an additional 200g of the Shetland. I need 500g of yarn total, but as the looping ply is most of the bulk I'm being over-cautious and not counting the weight of the core or binder.

I'm shooting for 120 meters per 100g (this depends on how thick or thin I spin the yarn), so that means 600 meters of finished yarn. 3 plies means at least 1800m over all the plies, though it will realistically be more because the looping ply... loops... and needs to be longer.

SO! That's a lot of spinning! I'd better get started.
